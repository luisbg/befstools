befstools consists of the program mkfs.befs to create BeOS file systems.
Soon to include befslabel to check the label of a such file system.
The befstools are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 or later. See the file
COPYING for details.


### Build Requirements

befstools recommends libudev. It is used in mkfs.befs to collect additional
information about the device to format in order to refuse potentially unsafe
operations without additional confirmation.


### Installing

befstools are built using an autoconf/automake system, so the standard method
applies:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

You need to have superuser privileges in order to install into the standard
system wide locations.

### Building from the VCS repository

If you are working directly from a git clone of the befstools repository,
you will find that you can not run "./configure" straight away because it,
like other autogenerated files for the build system, is not included in the
repository.

First, autoconf and automake have to be installed.  Then you can run
"autoreconf -i" to generate all the required files.
